Iâ€™m Ylva Biri, a PhD candidate in linguistics, researching the sociolinguistics and pragmatics of social media interaction. In other words, I want to learn whether different groups of social media users use different kinds of language - in terms of vocabulary, grammar as well as deeper meaning.

I work with R and Python to explore corpus linguistics, NLP, data analysis and visualization.
